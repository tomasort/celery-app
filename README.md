# Flask App with Celery, SocketIO, PostgreSQL, and Docker

This project demonstrates a simple Flask application integrated with Celery and SocketIO for background task processing and real-time communication. The application uses PostgreSQL as the database, all of which are containerized using Docker.

## Features

- **Flask:** A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **Celery:** A distributed task queue for handling asynchronous background tasks.
- **SocketIO:** Real-time bidirectional communication between the client and server using WebSockets.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **Docker:** Containerization of the Flask app, Celery, PostgreSQL, and Redis (used as the message broker for Celery).
- **Docker Compose:** Simplifies the orchestration of multi-container Docker applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-celery-socketio.git
   cd flask-celery-socketio
   ```

2. **Build and run the containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - The Flask app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
   - PostgreSQL will be running on `localhost:5432`.

### Stopping the Application

To stop the application and remove the containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Real-Time Task Updates with SocketIO

This app demonstrates how to trigger a long-running task via Flask and provide real-time progress updates to the client using SocketIO. 

When the task starts, it is processed in the background by Celery, and progress updates are sent to the client using WebSockets.

### Starting a Task

1. Start the Flask app and Celery worker by running the following:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Click the "Start" button to initiate a long-running task.

As the task progresses, updates will be pushed to the client and reflected in the UI (e.g., updating a progress bar).

### Database Migrations

To apply database migrations:

1. Access the running Flask container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web bash
   ```
2. Run the migration commands inside the container (e.g., using Flask-Migrate or Alembic).

### Customization

Feel free to customize the repository to suit your specific needs. You can add more Flask routes, configure environment variables, or integrate additional services such as Redis or RabbitMQ for Celery.

### Technologies Used

- **Flask:** Serves the web application and handles routing.
- **Celery:** Processes background tasks, such as long-running operations.
- **Redis:** Used as a message broker for Celery.
- **SocketIO:** Enables real-time progress updates from background tasks to the client.
- **PostgreSQL:** Stores persistent data.

This project is a simple demo to experiment with Celery, WebSockets, and background tasks in Flask. It demonstrates real-time communication between the server and client while offloading heavy processes to the background with Celery.
